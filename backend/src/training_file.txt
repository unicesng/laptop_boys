Overview of SASB Standards
The SASB Standards are a set of 77 industry-specific sustainability accounting standards ("SASB Standards" or
"Industry Standards"), categorised pursuant to the Sustainable Industry Classification System
 (SICS
).
SASB Standards include:
1. Industry descriptions – which are intended to help entities identify applicable industry guidance by describing the
business models, associated activities and other common features that characterise participation in the industry.
2. Disclosure topics – which describe specific sustainability-related risks or opportunities associated with the
activities conducted by entities within a particular industry.
3. Metrics – which accompany disclosure topics and are designed to, either individually or as part of a set, provide
useful information regarding an entity’s performance for a specific disclosure topic.
4. Technical protocols – which provide guidance on definitions, scope, implementation and presentation of
associated metrics.
5. Activity metrics – which quantify the scale of specific activities or operations by an entity and are intended for use
in conjunction with the metrics referred to in point 3 to normalise data and facilitate comparison.
Entities using the SASB Standards as part of their implementation of ISSB Standards should consider the relevant
ISSB application guidance.
For entities using the SASB Standards independently from ISSB Standards, the SASB Standards Application
Guidance establishes guidance applicable to the use of all Industry Standards and is considered part of the
Standards. Unless otherwise specified in the technical protocols contained in the Industry Standards, the guidance in
the SASB Standards Application Guidance applies to the definitions, scope, implementation, compilation and
presentation of the metrics in the Industry Standards.
Historically, the SASB Conceptual Framework set out the basic concepts, principles, definitions and objectives that
guided the SASB Standards Board in its approach to setting standards for sustainability accounting.

Use of the Standards
SASB Standards are intended to aid entities in disclosing information about sustainability-related risks and
opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity’s cash flows, its access to finance or cost of capital
over the short, medium or long term. An entity determines which Industry Standard(s) and which disclosure topics are
relevant to its business, and which associated metrics to report. In general, an entity should use the SASB Standard
specific to its primary industry as identified in SICS
. However, companies with substantial business in multiple SICS
industries should refer to and consider the applicability of the disclosure topics and associated metrics in additional
SASB Standards.
The disclosure topics and associated metrics contained in this Standard have been identified as those that are likely
to be useful to investors. However, the responsibility for making materiality judgements and determinations rests with
the reporting entity.
